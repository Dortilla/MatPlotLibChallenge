# MatPlotLibChallenge
## For this assignment, I was given data from a study done on mice with cancer and different medications that were being tested to find which was best at reducing the size of tumors, and I was tasked with the following: 
    * Checking the data for mice with duplicate time points, and removing that data
    * Generate a summary statistics able containg the mean, median, variance, standard deviation and SEM of the tumor volume for each treatment regimen
    * Generate a bar plot using both Pandas and MatPlotLib that shows the total number of measurements taken for each treatment regimen
    * Generate a pie chart using both Pandas and MatPlotLib that shows the distribution of male and female mice in the study
    * Calculate the final tumor volume of each mouse across four of the best performing treatment regimens, and calculate the quartiles and IQR to determine if there are any potential outliers in the data
    * Create a box and whisker plot using MatPlotLib that displays and potential outliers in the data
    * Select a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generate a line plot of timepoint versus tumor volume for said mouse
    * Create a scatter plot of mouse weight vs. average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen
    * Calcuate correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment regimen. Plot the linear regression model on top of the scatter plot from before
    * Look across the tables and figures that have been created and write at least three observations that can be made from the data
